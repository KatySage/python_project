Text based racing game?
drivers have various stats. (experience, racecraft, awareness, pace)
    Experience – A higher experience score will help players collect a greater number of ‘Resource Points’, used in the game to buy car upgrades.

    Racecraft – A higher racecraft score allow the driver to unleash more effective overtakes.

    Awareness – A higher score here will mean the driver is less likely to lose control of their car when the going gets tough.

    Pace – Quite simply, the higher the pace score, the more rapid a driver will be throughout a race.
