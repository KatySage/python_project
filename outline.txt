Text based racing game:

drivers have various stats. (experience, racecraft, awareness, pace)
    Experience – A higher experience score will help players collect a greater number of ‘Resource Points’, used in the game to buy car upgrades.

    Sneakiness – A higher racecraft score allow the driver to unleash more effective overtakes.

    Crashiness – A higher score here will mean the driver is less likely to lose control of their car when the going gets tough.

    Speed – Quite simply, the higher the pace score, the more rapid a driver will be throughout a race.


bonuses at various tracks based on their speeds or cornering

lap by lap selection of keep racing, pit for tires

chance of crashes, safety car means no passing
passing happens; per lap calculations and printing of current places

score poorly could result in getting fired


Pre-coding:

Classes: Drivers(Experience, Sneakiness, Recklessness), Karts(Speed, Handling), Tracks(Difficulty, Weather, Speed_or_Handling)


Phase 1:
-Classes
-Playthrough: laps, prompts, player choices
-Overtake opponents

Phase 2:
-Additional tracks & drivers
-Weather
-Durability
-Random events: 

Phase 3:
-Money: karts buying, repairs, upgrades
-Teammates & teams
-Points for season
-Grand Prix

Attributes: Speed, Knowledge , Alertness, Patience , Mechanical skills 

Driver 1: Experienced // Speed +-, Knowledge ++, Alertness +-, Patience +-, Mechanical skills ++
Driver 2: Crafty // Speed --, Knowledge ++, Alertness ++, Patience ++, Mechanical skills +-
Driver 3: Reckless // Speed ++, Knowledge --, Alertness +-, Patience +- , Mechanical skills +- 
Driver 4: ???
